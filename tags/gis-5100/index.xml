      <description>For this section of Lab 1, a suitability assessment for property development was performed in an area of Southern Oregon. First, information provided about soil and land types via raster images were reclassified into rasters with cell values indicating suitability ratings for development. Next, suitability ratings were assigned to slope values, using information from a DEM. Following this, rasters were generated indicating the distance from rivers and roads in this study area and these were also reclassified to suitability ratings.</description>

      <description>My name is Kristin. Applications in GIS (GIS 5100) is my second-to-last course (excluding the internship) in the GIS Certificate program at UWF. My experience in GIS prior to this program was limited. I work on image-processing software for the US Geological Survey, but the level of processing this software performs is usually done prior to importing images into ArcGIS or QGIS. I joined this program because I wanted to have a better background in GIS to further my knowledge and career.</description>
