      <description>For the first part of this week&amp;rsquo;s lab, we examined the effects of scale on data by examining vector and raster data at various scales and resolutions. For the second part of this week&amp;rsquo;s lab, we examined the how aggregating spatial data in different ways can result in different results. The primary thing we examined in this section was gerrymandered districts, which was fascinating.
Higher scale vector data tends to contain more details, more vertices, and generally more information.</description>

      <description>In this lab, we examined different methods for interpolating between points, including: Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW,) Thiessen (Nearest Neighbor), and Spline. Within Spline we investigated both the Tension and Regular options offered by ArcGIS. In Part A, we examined a set of elevation points in Kansas and created interpolated DEMs from them using IDW and Spline (tension) interpolations. Then, we subtracted the results using the Raster Calculator to analyze the differences between the results.</description>

      <description>In this week&amp;rsquo;s lab, we examined digital elevation models (DEMs) and surfaces represented by TINs (triangular irregular networks.) Unlike a DEM, a TIN is a geometric three dimensional model of a surface, rather than the traditional DEM raster model with a raster value for elevation at each pixel. The TIN model allows for geometric operations like intersection with a triangular facet to determine what is visible from a point, that would be more difficult to compute from a raster DEM surface.</description>

      <description>For this lab, we assessed the completeness of two road networks in Jackson County, Oregon using the criteria of total length over the whole dataset. That is, the longer road network is defined as more complete. We then also assessed completeness by the same criteria (total length) in each of 297 grid cells laid out over Jackson County. The two road networks compared for completeness where the TIGER road dataset from 2000 and a road centerline dataset, both provided via the UWF data repository.</description>

      <description>In the lab this week, we examined the positional accuracy of road networks. We compared road intersections in 2 datasets: shapefiles produced by the city of Albuquerque containing road center-lines, a shapefile with the same streets from StreetMap USA. These were compared with hand-marked intersections placed on orthophotos of the area.  The steps I took to perform this accuracy assessment were as follows:
 (1) Create a polygon the size of the test area and subdivide it into four quadrants so I could follow the requirement that 20% of points must fall in each quadrant.</description>

      <description>For the first lab of GIS5935, we examined accuracy and precision via two datasets. In the first, 50 measurements were taken of a single point using a Garmin GPS unit. First, the mean waypoint was calculated and placed on the map using the means of the x and y values of all the waypoints. Then, the distance of each waypoint from the average waypoint was calculated.
Horizontal accuracy was calculated as the distance (measured using a tool in ArcGIS) between the mean waypoint measurement and a provided reference waypoint.</description>

      <description>In this lab, first we mapped Hurricane Sandy&amp;rsquo;s full path from Tropical Depression to Category 2 Hurricane, and then we assessed the damage that occurred in a small parcel on the coast of New Jersey, using images from before and after Sandy&amp;rsquo;s arrival.
To assess this damage, after setting up the pre-Sandy and post-Sandy images in mosaics, I intersected the New Jersey parcels feature class with the Study Area feature class to just get the parcels in the study area so that it was clear which parcels were examined for damage.</description>

      <description>In this lab, we examined various different ways of calculating coastal flooding. First, we looked at LAS (LIDAR) datasets for an area of New Jersey, pre and post Hurricane Sandy. Visible changes in the width of the barrier island (it seems to have expanded in places) and the altitude of certain areas decreased or increased.
Next, we looked at Storm Surge in New Jersey by examining areas of a DEM under the average storm surge of 2m.</description>

      <description>To calculate a kernel density hotspot map, we used the Kernel Density tool built in to ArcGIS Pro, and then filtered out all results below 3 times the mean to produce the following map:
To create a Moran&amp;rsquo;s I hotspot map, we first joined census tract information with the homicide points to get a count of homicides for each census tract. Then, we used the number of households per tract to get a per-household crime rate.</description>

      <description>In this lab, LIDAR data was used to generate a map of the tree canopy density for a region of Shenandoah National Park, Virginia. This area lies in the Blue Ridge Mountains and along the Appalachian Trail.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the National Park Service map for part of this area: https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/upload/BigMeadows_RoadTrail.pdf !
Lidar data was provide in Lidar Point Cloud (LPC) format. This was used to create a DEM by filtering to include only ground points, and a DSM representing the canopy, which included only non-ground points.</description>

      <description>For this section of Lab 1, a suitability assessment for property development was performed in an area of Southern Oregon. First, information provided about soil and land types via raster images were reclassified into rasters with cell values indicating suitability ratings for development. Next, suitability ratings were assigned to slope values, using information from a DEM. Following this, rasters were generated indicating the distance from rivers and roads in this study area and these were also reclassified to suitability ratings.</description>

      <description>For this section of the first Lab, &amp;ldquo;Scenario 4,&amp;rdquo; the most suitable or least-cost corridor for black bear movement was calculated between two protected areas of Coronado National Forest in Southern Arizona. Criteria included in the suitability calculation were: elevation, distance from roads, and land cover types. ArcGIS Pro was used to create Cost Distance surfaces from each Protected Area, and these were then combined using the Corridor tool to generate a single corridor.</description>

      <description>For this week&amp;rsquo;s lab we exported KML files from ArcGIS Pro which contained: dot density information for the major cities in southern Florida, water features, and county lines in southern Florida. (The dot density and county lines were actually already provided in KMZ format as part of the lab,) and loaded them into Google Earth Pro, the downloadable desktop version of Google Earth.
For the only static map deliverable, I loaded these KML files into Google Earth and imported a legend.</description>

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s topic was Isarithmic mapping &amp;ndash; that is, mapping continuous values like precipitation or elevation. Israrithmic maps can feature continuous tones (unclassed) or hyposometric tints (classed, and usually separated by contour lines.)
This week&amp;rsquo;s goal was to map average annual precipitation from 1981 - 2010 in Wasington State, USA. We created maps using both continuous and hypsometric tinting and added a topography-based hillshade to add texture and interest to the maps.</description>

      <description>For this week&amp;rsquo;s lab, we map wine consumption and population density in Europe, using ArcGIS Pro and Adobe Illustrator to finish. Despite the look of the map, I did export it into Adobe Illustrator to finish it up, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much more than clean up the &amp;ldquo;inset&amp;rdquo; area and create the inset map lines. Population density is displayed via choropleths and wine consumption is displayed using red wine-colored proportional symbols.</description>

      <description>The goal of this week&amp;rsquo;s lab was to create four different maps using same dataset from the US 2020 Census in Miami-Dade county, two different ways. First, the primary goal was to classify the census tracts using 4 different classification methods: Natural Breaks, Equal Interval, Quantile, and Standard Deviation. These 4 classification methods are appropriate for use in different situations and each has their own strengths and weaknesses. First, the percentage of the population above 65 by census tract was classified in each of these four ways.</description>

      <description>The goal of this week&amp;rsquo;s module was to create a map of the schools in Ward 7 of Washington DC utilizing good cartographic design principles. The map was created solely in ArcGIS Pro using the data provided. I ended up using a very similar color scheme to the student example maps that were provided, after experimenting with my own ideas and coming to the conclusion that they all looked less professional.</description>

Previously, I had only used ArcGIS for labeling maps automatically. The lecture and reading covered the standards for labeling map features, including standards for points, lines, and areas, and mentioned to make sure to change the labels accordingly to make ordinal or nominal differences obvious (e.</description>

      <description>This map conveys a great deal of information without being overly cluttered, at two different levels of scale (state and county.) It’s visually appealing and very easy to pick out trends or clusters of ancestry across the US. Contextual spatial information (Canada and Mexico) are included, but muted and de-emphasized. This map definitely “maps substantial information” (condensed Tuftesm #1) – the most common ancestry in each county &amp;ndash; which stands out in the map and can be easily understood, “contains minimal crap” (condensed Tuftesm #4) – it contains no labels or symbols but is complete and doesn’t contain unnecessary information, and has a good map layout (condensed Tufetism #5) including sub-maps at appropriate scales and in sensible locations.</description>

      <description>For this week&amp;rsquo;s lab, after going through several exercises about using the different spatial filters, using histograms, and using band indicies in ERDAS imagine (and to a lesser extent in ArcGIS,) we created 3 output maps based on three mystery features described in this week&amp;rsquo;s lab. I identified Mystery Feature #1 as &amp;ldquo;water,&amp;rdquo; in particular the inlets in the upper-righthand corner of our image to be analyzed, Mystery Feature #2 as snow/ice in the mountains, and Feature #3 as the bay which showed high brightness in Layers 1-3, and to a lesser extent 4, but no brightness variation from the rest of the water in Layers 5-6.</description>

      <description>For this week&amp;rsquo;s lab, we used ERDAS Imagine for the first time and used it to view automatically classified land types of an image from Olympic National Park in Washington State.
I found ERDAS imagine surprisingly quick and straightforward to use! We selected a subset of the image and exported the result to a new .img file. We then loaded this .img file into ArcGIS and used it to create the actual map displayed in this blog post.</description>

      <description>In this week&amp;rsquo;s module, first we first created XY Data in an Excel spreadsheet and imported it into ArcGIS and then Geocoded addresses obtained from the Florida Department of Education website based on TIGER &amp;ldquo;All Line&amp;rdquo; files obtained from the US Census Bureau for Brevard County in Florida.
The first part of this week&amp;rsquo;s lab was very straightforward: parsing out lat/lon locations of Eagle Nests in Santa Rosa county given in degree-minute-second format and then converting them to decimal degrees using degrees + minutes/60.</description>

      <description>In this week&amp;rsquo;s lab, we completed two projects: collecting data using the smartphone app ArcGIS Collector and displaying it and exporting it, and using FGDL shapefiles of Florida Counties to explore the differences between three different projections.
The goal of the first lab was to collect condition data about some infrastructure in your neighborhood and then share it online via ArcGIS online, Google Earth, and also export the information so that others could use it in KML and Map Package form.</description>

      <description>For the second lab in GIS4043, we created a map of the University of West Florida&amp;rsquo;s location relative to the Escambia county line, interstates, and major rivers, along with a context map displaying all the counties of Florida. This was a more complete map than last week, containing a legend, title, and an indicator of the direction of north, and also a lot more work than last week. I had no idea how many design decisions go into the creation of a relatively simple map!</description>

      <description>For the first lab in the first week of Intro to GIS we created
and exported a simple world map with major cities and countries denoted using ArcGIS Pro. The general steps were as follows: (1) Create a new project in ArcGIS, (2) Add a dataset, consisting of shapefiles for major cities and countries of the world, (3) Modify the symbology used to display the data, and (4) Create a map layout and export it.</description>
